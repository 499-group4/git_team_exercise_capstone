- Selection Sort by Kanishka Verma

  I implemented selection sort in selection_sort.py and also created a test file containing a simple test in selection_sort_test.py. I then commited and pushed these changes to my branch called 'selection_sort' which I had previously made off of develop. I then made a Pull Request for my teammates to overview.
