## Feature list

- Selection Sort by Kanishka Verma

  I implemented selection sort in selection_sort.py and also created a test file containing a simple test in selection_sort_test.py. I then commited and pushed these changes to my branch called 'selection_sort' which I had previously made off of develop. I then made a Pull Request for my teammates to overview.
  
- Quick Sort by Rick Feng

  This is a impelementation of the feature quick sort for an array of integers. The sorting algorithm select a pivot for the array and proceed to sort based on pivot position, bigger goes to the right and smller goes to the left. This method will recursively separate the array into two different arrays based on the pivat. This process will occurs until the array only have maximum of two element per array. 
  
  
  
## Testing
